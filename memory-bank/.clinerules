# MindPattern Website Development Rules

## SVG Implementation Patterns

1. **Inline SVGs for Critical UI Elements**
   - Use inline SVGs for important UI elements like step illustrations and hero graphics
   - Benefits: Faster loading, no external requests, ability to style with CSS
   - Example: Step illustrations in "How It Works" section use inline SVGs

2. **SVG Icon System**
   - Use consistent SVG icons from Bootstrap Icons library
   - Apply currentColor for easy theming
   - Keep icon sizes consistent (24px for UI elements, 48px for feature icons)

3. **SVG Animation Techniques**
   - Use CSS for simple animations (hover effects, transitions)
   - Use JavaScript for complex animations (floating elements, parallax)
   - Ensure animations have appropriate performance optimizations

## CSS Organization

1. **Design System Structure**
   - Base styles in design-system.css
   - Component-specific styles in styles.css
   - Utility classes for common patterns
   - Media queries at the end of each file

2. **Variable Naming Conventions**
   - Use --prefix for all CSS variables
   - Color variables follow --color-name-shade pattern
   - Spacing variables follow --spacing-size pattern
   - Z-index variables follow --z-level pattern

3. **Responsive Breakpoints**
   - Mobile first approach
   - Breakpoints at 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px
   - Use min-width queries for progressive enhancement

## JavaScript Patterns

1. **Animation Performance**
   - Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
   - Debounce scroll events
   - Use CSS transforms and opacity for animations when possible
   - Avoid layout thrashing by batching DOM reads and writes

2. **Interactive Elements**
   - Use consistent hover and focus states
   - Implement keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
   - Ensure proper ARIA attributes for accessibility

3. **Feature Detection**
   - Check for feature support before using modern APIs
   - Provide fallbacks for older browsers
   - Use feature queries (@supports) in CSS when appropriate

## Image Handling

1. **SVG vs Raster**
   - Use SVGs for icons, illustrations, and UI elements
   - Use raster images (WebP preferred) for photos and complex graphics
   - Provide appropriate fallbacks for SVGs

2. **Responsive Images**
   - Use srcset and sizes attributes for responsive images
   - Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images
   - Optimize image file sizes without sacrificing quality

3. **Placeholder Strategy**
   - Use lightweight placeholder images during loading
   - Implement progressive loading for large images
   - Use appropriate alt text for all images

## Performance Considerations

1. **Resource Loading**
   - Critical CSS inlined in head
   - Non-critical CSS loaded asynchronously
   - JavaScript deferred when possible
   - Preload critical resources

2. **Animation Performance**
   - Use CSS properties that trigger only compositing (transform, opacity)
   - Avoid animations that trigger layout or paint
   - Use will-change property sparingly and appropriately

3. **Rendering Optimization**
   - Minimize DOM depth
   - Avoid layout thrashing
   - Use CSS containment where appropriate
   - Implement virtualization for long lists

## Accessibility Standards

1. **Semantic HTML**
   - Use appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose
   - Implement proper heading hierarchy
   - Use landmarks for major page sections

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Implement logical tab order
   - Provide visible focus indicators

3. **ARIA Implementation**
   - Use ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility
   - Implement appropriate roles for custom components
   - Ensure proper labeling of form elements and controls

## Recent Improvements

1. **SVG Illustrations**
   - Replaced missing image references with inline SVGs
   - Implemented consistent styling for SVG elements
   - Added hover effects for interactive SVGs

2. **Animation Fixes**
   - Fixed wave animation to prevent vertical movement
   - Optimized floating animations for better performance
   - Ensured animations don't interfere with content readability

3. **Responsive Enhancements**
   - Improved mobile layout for feature cards
   - Enhanced testimonial display on smaller screens
   - Optimized footer layout for better mobile experience
